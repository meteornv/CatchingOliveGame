Hi,

I made a little python game of a grand mother and her grand daughter catching falling olives and dodging falling branchs from trees. 

That game is inspired by my daughter and her grand mother harvesting olives this autumn 2023.

This is a python game that run with the module [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).

All the image was generated with Dall-E or local stable diffusion from [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
